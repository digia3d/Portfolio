      'Alex is a super friendly, helpful and supportive programmer. Whenever I am in trouble, as soon as I reached out to her, she always gave me exactly what I needed. Her help was always the one that leads to the solution. Even when we are not official peers of the group anymore, she always helped me whenever I am in trouble.
