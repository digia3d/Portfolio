            Hello! My name is Aleksandra Ujvari, a full-stack software
            developer with a passion for coding and problem-solving. As a
            previous owner of a cloth workshop, I developed excellent
            communication and organization skills, which I&apos;ve implemented in my
            work as a developer. After graduating with a digital marketing
            degree, I decided to pursue my passion for coding and enrolled in
            Microverse, a remote software development school, where I learned
            the importance of remote pair programming. I am committed to clean
            code and continuous learning, always seeking to expand my knowledge
            and skills in the field. I have experience creating websites for
            friends and family and find satisfaction in solving puzzles and
            optimizing code. I can help you build a product, feature, or
            website. Please feel free to look through some of my work and
            experience, and if you like what you see and have a project you need
            coded, don&apos;t hesitate to contact me. I&apos;m also a freelance designer
            with a demonstrated history of working in the information technology
            and services industry. If you need someone like me, I am available
            for hire.
